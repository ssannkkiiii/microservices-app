   git pull origin main
   ```
   
   This fetches and merges remote changes into your local branch.

2. **If there are merge conflicts**, Git will pause and ask you to resolve them. After resolving:
   ```powershell
   git add .
   git commit -m "Merge remote changes"
   ```

3. **Then push again:**
   ```powershell
   git push origin main
   ```

## Alternative: If you prefer a rebase instead of merge:

If you want a cleaner history, you can use rebase:

```powershell
git pull --rebase origin main
```

This replays your local commits on top of the remote commits. Then push:
```powershell
git push origin main
```

## If you're sure you want to overwrite remote changes (⚠️ use with caution):

If you're certain your local version should replace the remote (e.g., you made a mistake), you can force push, but this can overwrite others' work:

```powershell
git push --force origin main
```

**Warning:** Only use `--force` if you're working alone on this branch, as it rewrites remote history.

Start with `git pull origin main`, then push again.
